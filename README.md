# 🇸🇪 Swedish Medical Benchmark 🏥💻
Welcome to the official repository for the Swedish Medical Benchmark! This project aims to revolutionize how we assess and develop AI models in the medical domain, specifically tailored for the Swedish language. With your help, we can create a more inclusive, accurate, and impactful AI in healthcare. Let's make AI work for everyone!

## Goals 🎯
This project focuses on three primary goals:

## Translate Benchmarks to Swedish 📚➡️🇸🇪

Making existing benchmarks accessible to the Swedish-speaking medical community is crucial. This step involves:

Identifying key medical benchmarks in AI.
Translating these benchmarks into Swedish.
Ensuring the translations maintain the clinical integrity of the original benchmarks.
Create New Benchmark for Swedish 🛠️🆕
